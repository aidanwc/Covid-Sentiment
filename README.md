# Covid Sentiment Tracker

Covidsentiment.ca tracks how people are feeling about COVID-19 on Twitter by scraping nearly 50,000 tweets every single day. It uses NLP to analyze the tweets and assign a daily sentiment score. In addition, it tracks other metrics such as tweet breakdowns and the most mentioned phrases on Twitter of the hour. 

The tracker was coded in Python using the Django framework and uses a PostgreSQL database and Chart.js to store and display the metrics.
